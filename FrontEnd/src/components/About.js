                <p>
                    Our story begins in Late Autumn 1884, when gentleman pastoralist Emery Orphee enlisted Dr Diomira Ku to orgniase java developers in an effort 
                    to raise a trading company on the shores of the Pensacola. A series of legal operations were initialised using IB-LotusNotes on March 21, however they would not be completed until March 31, 
                    when the typeface of the SRS was changed from .42 GILROY to .17 Neue Grotesk. This precipitated the grand opening, where the studio was declared as 'ἄγμε πηδαλιούχος' to a 
                    crowd of 101 people. There were the 'Spring Months'; the running of AGME was peformed out of a 10x5 shipping container left from the wreck of the Palatka. Gatherings were done by candlelight, 
                    sweet Orphee dictating JSX fragments to huddled developer-hounds by means of string wound through fibrous git-jelly. At first, Ku was totally against 
                    the idea of customer/consumer relations and a de Maurier Novel was used in farcical emulation of human interfacing, by the means of feeding pages through a shredder to 
                    produce fertiliser. Emery began to eat the jelly. Following the conclusion of the winter sprint storage space was exapanded into a second, more oblong container, 8x8, thus 
                    paving the way for serious html operations and for the first time, the opening of frontseeding. 1892, procurement of a compney of CSS theatrics massively juiced productivity to tremendous 
                    accolade in the release of that same year. Yet, the situation changed in the form of 
                    'banking crisis' and all gitflow was halted. Conesequently Dr. Ku was unable to complete the splinting procedure that had been expected, forcing the developers into a cycle of 
                    crunch/burnout to resuscitate the ailing Orphee (who had at this point been attached by means of calcium tubing to serve as an emergent organic POM). This would be the 
                    direct cause of the fire scouring the wreck of the Palatka and AGME's flight to Victoria BC. However this occasion would prove joyous as in spite of second degree burning, 
                    SPRINTFOUR was met with applaud, owing to the valiant effort of spiders contracted to manage the trello board. Such an unexpected development paid in full the Jet Fuel 
                    debt and allowed for the formal refactoring of company grounds into the campus of the old GAS&FUEL corporation buildings. Such magnificent slabs of business space would 
                    nourish and nurse the ailing Orphee root branch and stem.
                    This began the next era of AGME, the silver age of whirlwind boardroom meetings, long coffee breaks and creeping automaons. From the immense AGME towers productivity flowed forth
                    like jelly, into the fathomless gullet of Orphee. The company was joined on weekdays by an unlikely duo; DRT Collinson, Esquire, and the soon-to-be Surveyor 
                    Jemima Kelvin. Collinson had just returned to the country after "completing" his infamous three-year ballooning marathon in Southeast Asia, and Kelvin was partway through her 
                    groundbreaking Birdsville Script study.  Together, the pair returned AGME to the public eye with the innovative introduction of Synergistic Postwise Autofolding, revolutionising 
                    the proform method and reinvigorating the market. And now it was so that very creature on earth, whether a walker scuttl-o or swimmer, had some representation in the development silos.
